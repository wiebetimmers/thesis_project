Update 25-5:
- min and max bounds are now plotted for populations + mean
- directory structure improved
- files are now redesigned to work best for experiment 1, 2, 3
- implemented best offspring selection
- plotting improved

### Working on:
- Finalizing the plots, labels, axis etc. 
- A situation in which we keep the output layer constant after a few training cycles, then only perform EA optimization on the non-output layers.
