Update 15-4: Corrected the mistakes that came to attention yesterday. Next to that, mini-batch gradient descent is now implemented (before, we only backpropagated after every epoch; now we backpropagate after every batch ). 


main_baseline_new.ipynb contains the baseline model. Can run on both Digits and MNIST dataset

main_reservoir.ipynb  contains the recurrent reservoir network. Can run on Digits.
